## How did I find Vite.js?
I'm using React.js to build web projects. I use 'create-react-app' when I create a React.js app. Really good for building new React.js app. But it's really slow for me. I thought I couldn't wait long to build the React.js app. So I started looking for a new tool to build React.js apps.
After searching for a few minutes I found [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/). I used it once to build a Vue.js application. But after a while I forgot. I tried to create a new project with Vite.js. It was extremely fast. And I'm really happy that we can build React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, Lit and vanilla.js apps with Vite.js. Moreover, you can choose between Typescript and Javascript when creating these projects.
